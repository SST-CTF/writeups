I wrote a little emulator for my own custom assembly language. Prove to me you can use it by writing the fibonacci sequence for me!

Your code will be injected with R0,R1,R2 = 0 and R3 is the sequence number, n, requested. The results should be R0 = Fn and R1 = n.

Hints: I start from n = 1 => F1 = 1, F2 = 1. Also the entire program is easily writable in typeable ascii which you need to send to the server (note: small bytes probaly will be dropped)
