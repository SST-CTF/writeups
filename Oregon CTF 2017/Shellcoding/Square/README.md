Square

Help us get root!

Give me x86 shellcode that will take the square root of a number. You may assume that the given number will be a perfect square. No floating point math is required. Your shellcode should expect input in eax and return its result in eax. Your shellcode must be EXACTLY 32 bytes (pad it with NOPs if it is shorter). Please provide input as raw bytes.
