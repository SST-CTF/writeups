Substring Alpha
10


Let's start off with something simple. We'll give you a sentence and a number of words to return
from the start or the end. Do this 100 times without failing and we'll give you a flag! Remember that
we need to know when you're done giving us input, so send a newline when you're done.


Example:

WE SEND: "Return the first 3 words: The cake is a lie\n"

YOU SEND: "The cake is\n"
