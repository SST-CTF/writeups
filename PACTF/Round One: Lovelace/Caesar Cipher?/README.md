# Caesar Cipher?
###### 20 Points


### Problem
"Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant only taste of death but once." (1007, 1008) Are you valiant enough to figure this out?

`5:6 1139:4 1620:3 172:4`

### Hint
There's a lot of text on the Internet and in print. What if you could send messages using all of that data? But you'd have to pick something pretty famous...

### Writeup
The title still gives us a hint, as well as the problem quote. This is an excerpt from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. We also see that this is from lines 1007 and 1008 from the story. I used this [online source][https://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=juliuscaesar&Scope=entire&pleasewait=1&msg=pl] which has all of the line numbers regardless of Act or Scene. From here now, we look at each line number and the word (l:w). From here, we get our flag word by word.

###### Flag: `the answer is fear`
