# Straight From The Emperor
###### 10 Points


### Problem
The Emperor says `ny_nx_tsq3_zumnqq_kwtr_mjwj_685dddedba`-what could it possibly mean? I hear he 'encrypts' numbers now too, something about appending them to the alphabet...

### Hint
Some say he's an emperor, I say he's a salad.

### Writeup
By the nature of the problem, we automatically assume this is a Caesar Shift Cipher, with the added step of appending the numbers with the alphabet. I used [Cryptii's](https://cryptii.com) Caesar Cipher decoder with the added change of the alphabet appended with the numbers 0-9 in order `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789`. After the shift, we get our flag.
