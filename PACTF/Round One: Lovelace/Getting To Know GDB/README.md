### Problem
A friend sent me this [mysterious binary](https://2018.pactf.com/static/ctfproblems/a7ab3479-712f-48b3-bee9-46071bf3aea0/mysterious_elf.771c3c9447cd). It's supposed to print out the flag, but it's giving me a weird poem and some hex instead.

### Hint
The flag is <i>in there somewhere</i>, but something gives me the feeling that searching the binary for strings won't help...

### Writeup


###### Flag: [ Flag ]
