# Credit Card Leak
###### 35 Points


### Problem
ShowShop was hacked, and all of their customer records were released online--including credit card numbers. One credit card in the leak is invalid, however. What is the invalid credit card number?

Here's the leak: [cc_leak.txt.bz2](https://2018.pactf.com/static/ctfproblems/97042e12-5f99-4e79-a703-5593d531e4a2/cc_leak.txt.eecc6f896436.bz2)

### Hint
The credit card numbers in the leak are obviouslly <i>all</i> invalid, but most would pass a certain credit card validity test. All credit card numbers except one, that is.
