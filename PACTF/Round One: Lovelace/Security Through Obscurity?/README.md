### Problem
We intercepted this message, but we can't make heads or tails of it. It was rattled off so fast, too... How could anyone be that good at using a cipher?

Anyway, here's the message. Good luck!

`Tązhii, Łį́į́ʼ, Dzeeh Mąʼii, Dibé yázhí, Wóláchííʼ, Tłʼízí Tin, Dibé Mósí, Łį́į́ʼ, Dzeeh, Dibé, Tązhii, Dzeeh, Gah, Neeshchʼííʼ, Dzeeh, Béésh dootłʼizh`

### Hint
This definitely doesn't look like English. What else could it be? Perhaps looking through the history books might help...
