### Problem
I was talking to one of my friends but I couldn't quite understand what he was saying. I think it might be important so here it is:
```
Nwh whdjwh qm uepen, T tjb tixgi jsrsh sigm gs mpzp wxqf iahxpv iw fslkt. pehgpxf{qtextz_glacz_elt_neinrw_qsg_bums_dcp}
```

### Hint
Why might the title matter?

### Writeup

Testing for a vigenere cipher, we go to [dcode](dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher)
Just through a statistical attack, we determine the key to be 
```pineapple```
